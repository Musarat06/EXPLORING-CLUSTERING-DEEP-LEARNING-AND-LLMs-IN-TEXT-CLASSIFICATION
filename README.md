"Exploring Clustering, Deep Learning, and LLMs in Text Classification" 


(https://lnkd.in/dz3NpvuZ) 

In this research, I explored the use of unsupervised learning, deep learning models, and Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT and GPT-4 to classify text data. üìä The study focused on evaluating these models using two diverse datasets: Apple product reviews and airline tweets.

Key findings:
BERT-based models achieved 81% accuracy on the Apple dataset and a 95% on the airline dataset.
GPT-4 also showed strong performance with 79% and 85% accuracy on the Apple and airline datasets respectively.

üîç The results highlight the superior performance of LLM models over traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms in sentiment classification tasks. Additionally, LLM models like GPT-4 require less data preprocessing, making them more efficient and easier to implement.
